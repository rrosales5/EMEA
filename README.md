This repository was created for learning purposes, such as
- to learn HTML and CSS by creating a test web site with multiple pages, controlled with one single style sheet
- to practice collaboration using git and github
- to simulate how to manage a project with several tasks

How to contribuite:
- fork the original repository
- clone the forked repo on your local computer, and work on the code (check projects for optional tasks)
- once finished with your changes, push the changes to your forked repo, and create a pull request
- follow up your pull request in the original repo (check for any possible comments).
- changes of "index.html" and "style.css" can, and SHOULD BE done in the main branch
- later on, each collaborator will create their own html file (webpage) on separate branches (named after the owner)..
